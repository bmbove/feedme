My Family called this the "Best Meatloaf Ever!!!". It's really good especially with the Spruced Up Mashed Potatoes(provided by another contributor). If you can find a restaurant near you that makes frsh salsa every day, or you like to make your own salsa, that will make the meatloaf even better! Highest recommendation.

I thought it was good and smelled awesome cooking. I did everyone the same. The only problem I had was it wouldn't cook, I probably cooked it for a half hour more. I think next time I would cook it at 375 instead of 350. It just was so pink and mushy. It got really frustrating since my sides were already done.
