I've made this about a dozen times in the last few months, so it's about time I
posted a review! Markypost was right: You won't be wiping up oodles of sauce
with your garlic bread when you make this dish--it's just not THAT kind of
pasta. I agree with other reviewers that you'll need to add some more olive oil
than the recipe calls for, or else it will tend to be "dry." I throw in a few
red chili pepper flakes with the anchovy and garlic saute, for a bit of zing.
Not everyone will agree with me, but I prefer to use panko (Japanese) bread
crumbs, because they're a bit coarser, and then I like to fry them in the hot
oil for a minute before turning off the heat and adding the parsley. I enjoy
the slight crunchy texture this adds to the final product. Parmesan might make
this dish too salty for some folks, but I can't imagine pasta without it, and
that's why a huge handful of fresh parsley is so important--it cuts right
through the salt and sort of lightens up the overall flavour. This tastes
strong, but not fishy, makes an excellent side dish, cheap and easy to prepare,
be brave and give it a try!

We weren't crazy about this. I didn't end up with a sauce - even when I added
more olive oil, it was just a sticky fishy blob that was hard to combine with
the noodles.
