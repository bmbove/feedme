Name: Citrus Chicken Stir Fry
Rating: 4.54


Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dry whole-wheat noodles
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup orange marmalade
1/3 cup tamari sauce
1 (1 inch) piece ginger root, peeled
 ground black pepper to taste
1 lemon, juiced
3 tablespoons peanut oil
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into thin strips
1 (16 ounce) bag frozen stir-fry vegetables, thawed


Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.

2. Stir in whole-wheat noodles and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is firm to the bite, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain well and set aside.

3. Combine chicken stock, orange marmalade, tamari sauce, whole ginger root piece, and ground black pepper in a pot over medium-high heat.

4. Bring sauce to a boil and reduce heat to medium. Simmer until sauce reduces and thickens; about 20 minutes.

5. Remove sauce from heat. Stir in lemon juice and set aside.

6. Heat peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

7. Cook and stir chicken in hot oil until golden, no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes.

8. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside, leaving oil in the pan.

9. Cook and stir the stir-fry vegetables in the same skillet used for the chicken until vegetables are almost tender, 4 to 5 minutes.

10. Remove ginger root piece from sauce and discard.

11. Stir chicken and sauce into vegetables and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.

12. Serve over whole-wheat noodles.
